// If you are using the updated planner.cpp, then you simply need to
// sort the list of TrainInfoPerStation objects in stnInfoList.  The
// function that calls Quicksort in planner.cpp (i.e. printStationInfo)
// will then automatically pretty-print the sorted list.
//
// USING THE UPDATED planner.cpp FILE IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED
//
// Notice that there is a variable K in Quicksort that is to be used as
// described in the problem statement in problems_statement.pdf
// Specifically, if the first call to Quicksort has an argument list of
// n TrainInfoPerStation objects, you can't use additional storage space
// for more than n/K TrainInfoPerStation objects overall (across all
// recursive calls), you must implement random choice for pivot (i.e.
// each element in the list being sorted should be equally likely to
// be chosen as pivot), and each call to finding a random pivot
// within the list being sorted must take time within O(K), regardless
// of how long the list to be sorted is.
//
// In the function signature of Quicksort, stnInfoList is a list of
// TrainInfoPerStation objects that is to be sorted. In the updated
// planner.cpp file, this list (unsorted) is already prepared for you,
// and you need to simply ensure that the list is sorted (see note
// below about sorting order) when Quicksort returns.
//
// A note about the sorting order:
//
// The final list should be sorted with respect to day of week (first)
// and departure time within the day (next).  Thus Sun 900 < Sun 1100
// < Mon 800 < Thu 700 < Fri 1200
//
//
// Based on how we saw some of you were trying to approach the problem
// in the lab of Sep 23, we are providing another function QuicksortSimple
// with a slightly extended signature. In addition to the list stnInfoList,
// which is passed as the first argument to QuicksortSimple, there are two
// integer parameters "start" and "end", just like in the usual Quicksort
// of an array (as in Prof. Naveen Garg's lectures, for example).
// How do we interpret these "start" and "end" variables in this case,
// when we are trying to sort a list?
// Well, here is one way of thinking about this: If we start
// counting elements of the list starting from stnInfoList and
// chasing "next" pointers until nullptr is reached, the corresponding
// elements can be thought of as elements of a (virtual) array indexed
// from 0 onwards.
// Then, the call to Quicksort must sort the part of the list
// consisting of elements at indices start, start+1, ... until end
// of the above virtual array.
// The whole point of this assignment is to have you do this without
// converting the whole list to an array.
//
// Remember it is indeed possible to solve this problem using the
// function Quicksort with only stnInfoList as its argument.  However,
// if you are finding it difficult to implement Quicksort, you can
// implement QuicksortSimple instead.  Those who implement both
// Quicksort and QuicksortSimple potentially stand to gain some bonus
// points.
